Observed Data:
Treatment conversion rate: 15.53%
Control conversion rate: 10.53%
Observed difference: +5.01 percentage points
Simulation Results:
Simulated differences range from -0.77% to +0.77%
Mean of simulated differences is nearly zero (-0.01%)
None of our 500 simulations produced a difference as large as 5.01%


Under our null hypothesis, we assumed no real difference between groups
Our simulations produced small random variations around zero
The actual observed difference (5.01%) is much larger than what we'd expect by chance
Therefore, none of our simulated differences exceeded the observed difference
Statistical Interpretation:
P-value of 0 means it's extremely unlikely to see such a large difference by chance
This suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis
With our significance level of 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis
This indicates the treatment (new page) has a significantly higher conversion rate
This is actually a very strong result suggesting that the difference between the pages is real and not due to random chance!
